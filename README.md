# Stock Market Simulator

## 🚀 Overview
This project is an AI-driven stock market simulator that allows users to trade stocks in real-time using reinforcement learning (RL) and sentiment analysis from financial articles. The simulator pulls real-time stock prices from an API and adjusts trading strategies based on market trends and news sentiment.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS, Recharts
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **AI**: TensorFlow (Reinforcement Learning), NLP for Sentiment Analysis
- **Stock Data**: Alpha Vantage, Finnhub, or Yahoo Finance API
- **Financial Articles**: NewsAPI + NLP (Transformers, NLTK)
- **Performance (Optional)**: C for performance optimizations

## ⏳ Development Plan

### Day 1 – Core Game Development (React UI, Stock Market Logic, & API Integration)
**Focus**: Basic Game + Trading System + Real-Time Stock Data

#### 🕒 Hour 1-2: Setup & Basic UI
- **Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS)**:
  - Initialize a React project.
  - Install Tailwind CSS and configure it.

- **Create UI Components**:
  - Dashboard: Displays player balance, stock prices, and trading buttons.
  - Stock Chart: Uses Recharts for dynamic visualization.
  - Trade Panel: Contains buy/sell buttons.

#### 🕒 Hour 3-4: Real-Time Stock Price API Integration
- **Backend (Python + FastAPI)**:
  - Set up FastAPI backend and install dependencies.
  - Fetch real-time stock prices from a stock price API (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Finnhub).

#### 🕒 Hour 5-7: Trading System
- **Frontend (React)**:
  - Use state management to store player balance, owned stocks, and transaction history.
  - Dynamically update the UI with price changes.

- **Backend (Python FastAPI)**:
  - Handle buy/sell transactions.

#### 🕒 Hour 8-10: Stock Market Logic & Sentiment Analysis Prep
- Introduce market events like random stock booms/crashes.
- Fetch financial news articles for sentiment analysis.

### Day 2 – AI with Reinforcement Learning & Financial Article Analysis
**Focus**: AI Trading Bots & Market Learning

#### 🕒 Hour 11-14: AI Trader (Basic Decision Making)
- **Backend (Python)**:
  - AI fetches real stock prices and implements a basic trading strategy, buying when the price is rising and selling when it is falling.

#### 🕒 Hour 15-18: AI with Reinforcement Learning (RL)
- **Backend (Python + TensorFlow)**:
  - Install TensorFlow and other dependencies.
  - Define and train an RL model for making trading decisions based on past stock data.

- **Deploy AI to Make Real-Time Trades**:
  - Use the trained RL model to make buy/sell decisions in real-time.

#### 🕒 Hour 19-22: Financial Article Sentiment Analysis
- **Backend (Python + NLP)**:
  - Install NLP packages for sentiment analysis.
  - Extract sentiment from financial articles using a sentiment analysis model.

- **AI Adjusts Trades Based on Sentiment**:
  - AI adjusts trading decisions based on positive or negative sentiment from financial news articles.

### Final 4-6 Hours – Polishing, Testing & Deployment

#### 🕒 Hour 23-26: UI/UX Enhancements
- Improve stock graphs, add animations, and optimize layout.
- Add tooltips for stock trends and AI decisions.

#### 🕒 Hour 27-30: Testing & Debugging
- Ensure that API calls work for stock prices and news.
- Test AI trading logic to ensure it reacts properly to market trends.
- Verify that the reinforcement learning model adjusts dynamically.

#### 🕒 Hour 31-34: Deployment
- **Frontend (React on Vercel)**:
  - Deploy the React frontend on Vercel.
  
- **Backend (FastAPI on Render/AWS)**:
  - Deploy the Python backend on Render or AWS.

## 🚀 Stretch Goals (If Time Allows)
- C module for performance optimizations (e.g., faster AI calculations).
- Stock market news events that dynamically impact AI trading.
- Multiple AI personalities (aggressive, cautious, reactive).
- Customizable player trading strategies.
